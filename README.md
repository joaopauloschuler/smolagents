***
### üî•üö® EXTREME SECURITY RISK üö®üî•
***

**This implementation grants agents extensive access and control over the environment in which they run.** This level of control is intentionally designed to enable powerful automation and interaction capabilities across different languages and the operating system (including file system access, running arbitrary OS commands, and executing code in various languages).

**CONSEQUENTLY, USING THIS SOFTWARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT CONTAINING SENSITIVE DATA, PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, OR IMPORTANT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS AND STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.**

**YOU MUST ONLY RUN THIS CODE INSIDE A SECURELY ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT** specifically set up for this purpose, such as:
*   **A dedicated Virtual Machine (VM):** Configure a VM with minimal or no sensitive data, isolated from your main network if possible. Treat anything inside the VM as potentially compromised.
*   **A locked-down Container (like Docker):** Use containerization to create an isolated filesystem and process space. Ensure no sensitive volumes from your host machine are mounted into the container. Limit network access if possible.

**DO NOT** run this code directly on your primary development machine, production servers, personal computer, or any environment with valuable data or system access you wish to protect.

**USE THIS SOFTWARE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK! The developers explicitly disclaim responsibility for any damage, data loss, security breaches, or other negative consequences resulting from the use of this software in an insecure or inappropriate environment.** This warning cannot be overstated.

coder_agent.run("Please list the files in the current folder.")
```

## Create a team of agents (sub-assistants) and use them as tools

### Core Concepts

Beyond Python Smolagents is built around the concept of AI agents equipped with tools to interact with their environment and solve tasks.

*   **Agents** (inherited from [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)): Autonomous entities powered by language models that receive instructions and use available tools to achieve objectives. Different agent types (`CodeAgent`, `ToolCallingAgent`, `MultiStepAgent`) are available, each tailored for potentially different purposes and capable of being configured with specific tool sets:
    *   `CodeAgent`: Specialized in code generation, execution, and debugging across multiple languages.
    *   `ToolCallingAgent`: A general-purpose agent capable of utilizing a defined set of tools.
    *   `MultiStepAgent`: Designed to break down complex tasks into smaller steps and execute them sequentially or iteratively.
*   **Models** (inherited from [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)): The underlying Language Models (LLMs) that provide the cognitive capabilities for the agents, enabling them to understand tasks, reason, and generate responses or code. The framework integrates with various LLMs via the LiteLLM library, allowing users to select models based on cost, performance, context window size, and specific capabilities.
*   **Tools:** (inherited from [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)): Functions or utilities that agents can call to perform actions in the environment. These abstract interactions such as running OS commands, accessing the filesystem, interacting with the internet, or executing code in different programming languages. Tools are fundamental; without them, agents can only generate text; with them, they can *act*. The framework provides many built-in tools, and users can define custom ones.
*   **Sub-assistants:** Instances of agents are treated as tools and provided to a primary agent (often called "the boss"). This allows a higher-level agent to delegate specific sub-tasks to specialized agents. For example, a main agent tasked with building a project might delegate code generation to a `CoderSubassistant` or research to an `InternetSearchSubassistant`. This enables building complex, modular artificial workforce and leverages the specialized capabilities of different agent configurations.
*   **Base Tools (`add_base_tools=True/False`)** (inherited from [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)): A crucial parameter when initializing agents. It controls whether an agent automatically receives a default, standard set of tools provided by the Beyond Python Smolagents framework.
    *   Setting `add_base_tools=True` equips the agent with a common set of utilities right out of the box. This set typically includes tools for basic file operations (`save_string_to_file`, `load_string_from_file`), web interaction (`VisitWebpageTool`, `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`), and Python execution (`PythonInterpreterTool`), among others. These are added *in addition to* any tools explicitly provided in the `tools` list during initialization. This is useful for creating general-purpose agents.
    *   Setting `add_base_tools=False` means the agent will *only* have access to the tools explicitly passed to it via the `tools` parameter during initialization. This allows for creating highly minimal or very specifically-purposed agents with a restricted set of actions, which can be beneficial for security or task focus.


### Creating the team
Beyond Python Smolagents allows you to compose complex working groups by having agents delegate tasks to other specialized agents, referred to as sub-assistants. This modular approach helps manage complexity and leverage agents optimized for specific tasks (e.g., coding, internet search, summarization).

The library provides wrapper classes (Subassistant, CoderSubassistant, InternetSearchSubassistant, Summarize, etc.) that turn an agent instance into a tool that another agent can call.

Here's an example demonstrating how to set up a "boss" agent that can utilize other agents as sub-assistants:
```
no_tool_agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=[], model=model, add_base_tools=False)
tooled_agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=tools, model=model, add_base_tools=True)
internet_search_agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=[save_string_to_file, load_string_from_file], model=model, add_base_tools=True)

subassistant = Subassistant(tooled_agent)
internet_search_subassistant = InternetSearchSubassistant(internet_search_agent)
coder_subassistant = CoderSubassistant(coder_agent)
summarize = Summarize(no_tool_agent)
summarize_url = SummarizeUrl(no_tool_agent)
summarize_local_file = SummarizeLocalFile(no_tool_agent)
get_relevant_info_from_file = GetRelevantInfoFromFile(no_tool_agent)
get_relevant_info_from_url = GetRelevantInfoFromUrl(no_tool_agent)

tools = [save_string_to_file, load_string_from_file, copy_file, get_file_size,
  source_code_to_string, string_to_source_code, pascal_interface_to_string,
  replace_on_file, replace_on_file_with_files,
  subassistant, coder_subassistant, internet_search_subassistant,
  summarize, summarize_url, summarize_local_file,
  get_relevant_info_from_file, get_relevant_info_from_url,
  run_os_command, run_php_file, compile_and_run_pascal_code,
  ]

task_str="""Code, test and debug something that will impress me!
For completing the task, you will first plan for it.
You will decide what task will be assigned to each of your sub-assistants.
You will decide the need for researching using internet_search_subassistant before you actually start coding a solution."""

the_boss = CodeAgent(model=coder_model, tools = tools, add_base_tools=True)
the_boss.run(task_str)
```

## Use heavy thinking
Using "Heavy Thinking" is typically more computationally intensive and time-consuming than basic single-agent tasks, but it is designed to yield superior results for difficult problems that benefit from a more thorough, multi-pass approach.
`evolutive_problem_solver` combines evolutive computing, genetic algorithms and agents to produce a final result.

The "Heavy Thinking" method within Beyond Python Smolagents represents an advanced paradigm for tackling highly complex or open-ended problems that may not be solvable in a single agent turn. It's particularly useful for tasks requiring significant iterative refinement, exploration, or multi-step reasoning, such as generating comprehensive documentation from a large codebase or complex coding tasks.

While `evolutive_problem_solver` internal workings involve sophisticated logic, the user interacts with it by providing a detailed task prompt and a set of tools. `evolutive_problem_solver` has an iterative process, potentially involving multiple agent interactions, intermediate evaluations, and refinements over several "steps" and "agent_steps" within each step, aiming to converge on a high-quality solution.

Here is how you might conceptually set up and invoke the `evolutive_problem_solver` for a task like generating comprehensive documentation from source code. This example focuses on *how* you would structure the input prompt and call the function:

```
!git clone git@github.com:joaopauloschuler/neural-api.git
current_source = source_code_to_string('neural-api')
project_name = 'neural-api'
task = """You have access to an Ubuntu system. You have available to you python, php and free pascal.
You are given the source code of the """+project_name+""" project in the tags <file filename="..."> source code file content </file>.
This is the source code:"""+current_source+"""
Your highly important and interesting task is producing a better version of the README.md file.
You will save the updated versions of the README.md into new files as directed.
The original version of the readme file is provided in the tag <file filename="README.md"><file>.
When asked to test, given that this is a task regarding documentation, you should review the README file.
When asked to code, you will produce documentation.

You will write the documentation in a technical and non commercial language.
You contribution will be helping others to understand how to use this project and its inner workings so future
developers will be able to build on the top of it.
It would be fantastic if you could add to the documentation ideas about to solve problems using this project. Solving ideas about how to use it to solve problems in the real world.
For saving documentation, use the tags <savetofile> and <appendtofile>. Trying to save documentation via python code is just too hard and error prone.
When asked to test or review documentation, make sure that referred files or functions do actually exist. This is to prevent broken links.
Your documentation should focus on existing features only. Do not document future or to be be developed features.
Your goal is documentation.
Avoid adding code snippets.
"""
print("Input size:", len(task))
# Run the evolutive solver
evolutive_problem_solver(
    coder_model,       # The LLM to use
    task,              # The task description
    agent_steps=54,    # Number of steps each agent can take
    steps=4,           # Number of evolutionary iterations
    start_now=True,    # Start from scratch
    fileext='.md',     # File extension for outputs
    tools=tools        # Tools available to the agents
)
```

The source code above shows one of the core strengths of Beyond Python Smolagents: Its ability to work with codebases across multiple languages to generate and update documentation automatically. The `source_code_to_string` and `pascal_interface_to_string` tools are particularly useful here, allowing agents to ingest the codebase structure and content.

For complex documentation tasks, such as generating a comprehensive README from a large project, you should leverage advanced techniques provided by `evolutive_problem_solver`.

### Heavy thinking inner working

**1. Overall Workflow:**

The `evolutive_problem_solver` function sets up a loop where a `CodeAgent` acts as both a coder and a critic. It starts with initial solutions, then enters a cycle of:
1.  Analyzing and comparing current solutions.
2.  Potentially mixing solutions if beneficial.
3.  Selecting the "best" current solution.
4.  Generating two new alternative solutions by applying improvements suggested by the agent itself, potentially guided by past advice.
5.  Refining the new solutions (detailing changes, testing, getting advice).
6.  Potentially merging smaller new solutions with the current best.

This process simulates an evolutionary cycle where solutions compete, combine (mixing), and are refined based on criteria evaluated by the AI agent, aiming to improve the quality of the solution over time. The `advices.notes` file serves as a form of accumulated knowledge or 'genetic memory' for the agent across iterations. The process repeats for a fixed number of `steps`.

**2. `get_local_agent()` Inner Function:**

This helper function is responsible for creating and configuring a `CodeAgent` instance based on the parameters passed to the main `evolutive_problem_solver` function. It sets up the agent's tools, model, import permissions, max steps, callbacks, executor type, system prompt, and log level. This ensures that a fresh agent instance with the desired configuration is available whenever needed during the process.

**3. `test_and_refine(local_agent, solution_file)` Inner Function:**

This function orchestrates a series of refinement steps for a given `solution_file` using the `local_agent`. It guides the agent through the following tasks:
*   **Refine 1:** Prompts the agent to detail the changes it made (presumably in the immediately preceding step where the solution file was created or modified).
*   **Refine 2:** Instructs the agent to review and test its own solution. If the agent feels it needs further refinement, it's prompted to update the full source code in the specified `solution_file` and call `final_answer("Task completed! YAY!")`.
*   **Refine 3:** Asks the agent to provide any advice it would give to its future self based on the current task and solution process. The output of this step is captured as `new_advice`. If `new_advice` is not empty, it is appended to a file named `advices.notes`, separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).

**4. Main Execution Logic:**

*   **Initialization:**
    *   A `local_task_description` is created, wrapping the original `task_str` in `<task>` tags.
    *   A list `valid_solutions` is defined to hold the base filenames for the three potential solutions ('solution1', 'solution2', 'solution3').
    *   A `motivation` string is defined, encouraging the agent to be extensive, detailed, and creative.

*   **Initial Solution Generation (`if start_now:`):**
    *   If `start_now` is True, the process begins by generating the first three distinct solutions.
    *   A `local_agent` is obtained using `get_local_agent()`.
    *   The agent is run three times, each time tasked with solving the `local_task_description` with the added `motivation` and saving the output to `solution1`, `solution2`, and `solution3` respectively (with the specified `fileext`). The `reset=True` ensures each initial generation starts with a fresh context for the agent.
    *   After each initial solution is generated, `test_and_refine` is called for that solution file to detail changes, test, and capture advice.

*   **Evolution Loop (`for i in range(steps):`):**
    *   The code enters a loop that runs for `steps` iterations, representing the evolutionary process.
    *   Inside the loop, a new `local_agent` is created at the start of each iteration.
    *   **Analysis and Comparison:**
        *   A detailed `task_description` is created. This prompt includes the original task, the content of `solution1`, `solution2`, and `solution3` (loaded using `load_string_from_file`), all enclosed in appropriate XML-like tags (`<solution1>`, etc.).
        *   The agent is instructed to analyze these three solutions, explain their advantages and disadvantages, prioritize solutions with more features, and output the analysis as text using `final_answer()`. The agent is explicitly told *not* to code anything except calling `final_answer` with text.
        *   The agent is run with this analysis task (`reset=True` for a fresh start).
    *   **Mixing Decision:**
        *   If it's not one of the last two steps (`i < steps - 2`), the agent is asked if mixing parts of the solutions would be beneficial.
        *   The agent's response is captured, and if it's 'yes', the `should_mix` flag is set to True.
    *   **Mixing Logic (`if should_mix:`):**
        *   If mixing is deemed beneficial, `solution2` is chosen as the destination file for the mixed solution.
        *   The agent is tasked with mixing parts of the existing solutions into `solution2` and saving the full result there.
        *   `test_and_refine` is called on `solution2`.
        *   `continue` skips the rest of the current loop iteration (selection and alternative generation) and proceeds to the next evolutionary step with the potentially mixed `solution2` now available for comparison.
    *   **Best Solution Selection:**
        *   If mixing is not happening, the agent is asked to select the best solution among `solution1`, `solution2`, and `solution3` by calling `final_answer()` with the chosen filename.
        *   The selected filename is stored in `selected_solution`.
    *   **Best Solution Handling:**
        *   If `selected_solution` is one of the valid filenames, the corresponding file is copied to `best_solution.best`.
        *   **Alternative Generation and Improvement (`if i < steps - 1:`):**
            *   If it's not the very last step (`i < steps - 1`), the process prepares to generate alternative solutions based on the newly selected `best_solution.best`.
            *   The current `best_solution.best` is copied to `solution3` to serve as a baseline for comparison in the next iteration.
            *   A loop runs twice (for `alternatives_cnt` 0 and 1), targeting `solution1` and `solution2` as the files for the new alternatives.
            *   For each alternative:
                *   The agent is presented with the current `best_solution.best` and the accumulated `advices.notes` and asked to suggest improvements (outputting text via `final_answer`).
                *   The agent is asked to randomly pick one suggestion and code it.
                *   The agent is run to implement the selected improvement, tasked with updating the *existing* solution rather than starting a new one. For the first alternative (`alternatives_cnt == 0`), the agent is encouraged to be bold and add many improvements.
                *   The agent is asked if more review/testing is needed.
                *   The agent is instructed to save the *full* updated solution to the current `solution_file` (`solution1` or `solution2`) using `<savetofile>` tags and confirm completion with `final_answer("Task completed! YAY!")`.
                *   `test_and_refine` is called on this updated solution file.
                *   **Merging Smaller Solutions:** A peculiar step checks if the newly generated `solution_file` is *smaller* than the `best_solution.best`. If it is, the agent is tasked with merging the `best_solution.best` and the new `solution_file`, assuming the larger `best_solution.best` might contain valuable parts missing from the smaller new version. The merged result is saved back to the `solution_file`.
    *   **Error Handling:** A `try...except` block is present to catch potential errors during the loop iteration, printing 'ERROR'.

**5. Return Value:**

After the evolutionary loop completes (`steps` iterations), the function returns the content of the final (best) solution.

## Available agent tools

The `bp_tools.py` files provides a suite of functions and classes that can be used as tools by agents. This list details key tools and a brief description of their function:

*   `run_os_command(str_command: string, timeout: integer)`: Executes an arbitrary command in the host operating system's shell (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `pip install <package>`, `apt-get update`). Returns the standard output from the command. Use with extreme caution due to security implications.
*   `compile_and_run_pascal_code(pasfilename: string, timeout: integer)`: Compiles and executes a Free Pascal source file (`.pas`). Accepts standard Free Pascal compiler options via the `pasfilename` string. Returns the output of the compiled program.
*   `run_php_file(filename: string, timeout: integer)`: Executes a PHP script file (`.php`) using the installed PHP interpreter. Returns the standard output generated by the script.
*   `source_code_to_string(folder_name: string)`: Recursively scans a specified folder and its subfolders for common source code file types (.py, .pas, .php, .inc, .txt, .md). It reads their content and concatenates them into a single string, structured using `<file filename="...">...</file>` XML-like tags. This is invaluable for giving an agent a comprehensive view of a project's source code for documentation, analysis, or refactoring tasks.
*   `string_to_source_code(string_with_files: string, output_base_dir: string = '.', overwrite: boolean = True, verbose: boolean = False)`: Performs the inverse operation of `source_code_to_string`. It parses a structured string (like the output of `source_code_to_string`) and recreates the specified files and directory structure within the `output_base_dir`. Useful for agents generating multiple code or documentation files.
*   `pascal_interface_to_string(folder_name: string)`: Specifically scans Pascal source files in a folder and extracts only the content located within the `interface` section of units, ignoring comments and strings. The extracted content is returned in a string structured with `<pascal_interface filename="...">...</pascal_interface>` tags. Helps agents understand Pascal unit dependencies.
*   `save_string_to_file(content: string, filename: string)`: Writes the given string `content` to the specified `filename`. If the file exists, it is overwritten. A fundamental tool for agents to output generated text or code.
*   `load_string_from_file(filename: string)`: Reads the entire content of the specified `filename` and returns it as a single string. Allows agents to read existing files.
*   `copy_file(source_filename: string, dest_filename: string)`: Copies the file located at `source_filename` to `dest_filename`. Standard file system copy operation.
*   `get_file_size(filename: string)`: Returns the size of a specified file in bytes as an integer. Useful for file management tasks.
*   `replace_on_file(filename: string, old_value: string, new_value: string)`: Reads the content of `filename`, replaces all occurrences of `old_value` with `new_value` in the content, and writes the modified content back to the same file. Returns the modified content string. Useful for in-place file patching.
*   `replace_on_file_with_files(filename: string, file_with_old_value: string, file_with_new_value: string)`: Reads content from `file_with_old_value` and `file_with_new_value`, then replaces all occurrences of the old content with the new content within the `filename` file. Returns the modified content string of `filename`.
